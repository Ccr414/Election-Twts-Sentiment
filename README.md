ELECTION TWEETS SENTIMENT ANALYSIS

A Sentiment Analysis project investigating the sentiment on social media of presidential candidates during the 2016 and 2020 election. The project utilizes the
Long-Short Term Memory neural network to build an algorithm capable of classifying tweets as positive or negative sentiment. Two such neural networks were created, one utilizing
transfer learning from the Roberta NLP model, and the other created by myself. Both models were trained on a dataset of various tweets labelled by sentiment.

The goal of this project is to understand how accurately social media sentiment reflects the election results from the broader voter base.

All data files for the project are found under the "data" folder. The "datapreprocessing" code file is for preparing the data for the model, and the "modeltraining" file is for building the models. There will later be a third file meant to visualize the results of the model, this will be the file meant to be run.

This project is still a work in progress and will be updated when significant changes are made.
