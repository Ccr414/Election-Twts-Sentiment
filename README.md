A Sentiment Analysis project investigating the sentiment on social media of presidential candidates during the 2016 and 2020 election. The project utilizes the
Long-Short Term Memory neural network to build an algorithm capable of classifying tweets as positive or negative sentiment. Two such neural networks were created, one utilizing
transfer learning from the Roberta NLP model, and the other created by myself. Both models were trained on a dataset of various tweets labelled by sentiment.
